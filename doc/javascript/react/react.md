```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
cd my-app
npm run start   # or npm start - spawns off a server which reloads the page as we save our files
npm run test    # or npm test  - uses Jest, it automatically runs as soon as it detects changes
npm run build   # creates an optimized JS and CSS build in ./build/static/js and ./build/static/css respectively.
```

If you'd like, you can run `npm run start` and `npm run test` side by side so that you can preview changes and test them simultaneously.
